Autoclicker for Youtube's latest "feature" - Video paused. Continue watching?

For XUL based browsers only.

Works with Pale Moon and Basilisk

Basically a plugin that works similarly to YouTube NonStop (for Firefox) <https://github.com/lawfx/YoutubeNonStop> but for XUL browsers.  Does NOT work with Firefox.  Use <https://github.com/lawfx/YoutubeNonStop> for Firefox.
